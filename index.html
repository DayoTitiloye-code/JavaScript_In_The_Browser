    <p id="wraith">Wraith is a whirlwind fighter, able to execute deadly attacks and manipulate spacetime by opening rifts in the fabric of
    reality — but those abilities came at a price. Years ago, she woke up in an IMC detention facility with no memory of who
    she was. Senior Science Pilot Renee Blasey, who volunteered as guinea pig for her own experiments... whose partner
    betrayed her and locked her away… no longer existed. All that was left was a timid girl, frightened by a cacophony of
    voices in her head, until another version of herself appeared and taught her to listen to the voices. Following her
    lead, Wraith found the strength to break free from her prison and escape into a different reality - this reality.
    Finally free, but still robbed of her memories, Wraith continues her quest to learn more about who she was before the
    experiments. With so many of the Apex Games held on old IMC bases, Wraith now competes so she can access the mysterious
    facilities and learn more about who she was. She remains a fixture of the Apex Games, and with every match she gets
    closer to the truth...</p>
    <p id="bangalore">Born into a military family where she, her parents, and her four older brothers all served with the IMC, Bangalore has
    been an exceptional soldier her whole life. Dedicated to the IMC cause, she was top of her class at the IMC Military
    Academy and the only cadet who could take apart a Peacekeeper, equip it with a Precision Choke hop-up, and put it back
    together in under twenty seconds – blindfolded.In the months following the Battle at Gridiron, the IMS Hestia, with Anita and brother Jackson on board, was attacked by unknown assailants. A bomb on the outer hull blew out a chunk of the ship… but not before Jackson shielded her,
    sacrificing his own life to save hers. Anita watched helplessly, as Jackson was sucked out into the vacuum of space.
    After crashing on a Syndicate planet, Anita looked for both work, and the brother she refused to believe had died, so
    they could begin the decades-long trip back home. Now, she fights to raise money in the Apex Games, in the hopes of
    finding a pilot willing to take the epic trip back home to reunite with what remains of her family.</p>
    <p id="pathfinder">Pathfinder is the picture of optimism, despite his circumstances. A MRVN (Mobile Robotic Versatile eNtity) modified to
    specialize in location scouting and surveying, he booted up decades ago in an abandoned warehouse with no idea who
    created him or why. With only his MRVN designation to hint at his identity, Pathfinder eventually set off in search of
    his creator.
    Pathfinder has learned much in his travels since then (like how to make a mean Eastern Leviathan Stew) but hasn’t come
    any closer to finding his creator. Still, he’s never given up hope, and has joined the Apex Games to gain a
    following--and hopefully draw the attention of his maker. In the meantime, he remains enthusiastic and helpful, always
    ready to make new friends (then shoot them).</p>
